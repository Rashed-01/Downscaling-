# Downscaling-

This data set consists of One degree and Quarter degree data of various variables. The variables considered include: i) normalized difference index (NDVI), ii) land surface temperature (LST), iii) evapotranspiration (ET), iv) bare soil evaporation (BE), v) soil moisture (SM), vi) surface runoff (SR), vii) subsurface runoff (SSR), viii) canopy water storage (CWS), ix) canopy water evaporation (CWE), x) precipitation (P), and xi) air temperature (AT). 
The python scripting is available for the downscaling of the one degree data to quarter degree. This scripting involves various components like anomaly detection, rainfall pattern and correlations, Principal Component Analysis, Long short term memory units codes are available.
